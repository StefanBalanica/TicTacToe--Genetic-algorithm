Following the principles of genetics, the algorithm devises an efficient strategy to play X and 0 against a player. The initial population of solutions (strategies) evolves over time, constantly approximating the global optimum, reflecting natural processes.

Just as mutations in nature do not always lead to the perfect outcome, genetic algorithms do not always achieve the global optimum. However, they tend to approach it over time.
